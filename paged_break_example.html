            <h2>Who Owns the Map of the World?</h2>
            <p>
              The imaginative literary mind is as boundless as it is borderless
              and bountiful in its way, finding ways of powerfully creating anew
              the already imagined with the unimagined or unimaginable. Possibly
              George Orwell had thought something like this when he explained
              that the imagination was like certain wild animals that do not
              breed in captivity, and that writers who denied this fact were in
              effect demanding their own destruction.<a
                href="https://meanjin.com.au/essays/a-self-governing-literature/#_ftn1"

              The dreamlike state of imagining is continuously curious while it
              shifts and reshapes its positioning and influences. But
              imagination is never alone. There is a fight going on all day long
              in the mind of the writer about how to counterbalance the fanciful
              world of the imagination.
            </p>
            <h3>This is an h3 in the danger zone ⚠</h3>
            <p>
              The moral compass governs, asserts its sovereignty and wants you
              to impose some sense of restraint on flights of fancy. It wants
              you to be mindful of the reality of what writing ought to be, and
              to take notice of real or perceived restrictions,
              responsibilities, expectations that call into question, to take
              another deeper look about what is going on in your world. It needs
              you to rein in or realign the imagination, to decrease its force
              in these continuous arguments and counter-arguments to control the
              process and risk-taking through each long literary journey.

              I am a member of the Waanyi Nation of the lower southern highlands
              of the Gulf of Carpentaria. Our traditional lands, stories and
              laws situated in northern Australia lie about 150 kilometres south
              of the northern coastline on each side of the Northern Territory
              and Queensland borders. Norman B. Tindale, the Australian
              anthropologist, archaeologist and ethnologist, in his map of
              Aboriginal Australia first published in 1974, estimated that
              Waanyi people held about 25,000 square kilometres of country.
            </p>
            <p>
              The geographical features of our traditional lands are savannah
              grasslands, arid-zone forests and ever-flowing, spring-fed rivers
              covered with water lilies and lined by pandanus, palms and figs.
              The land can be stilled with great atmospheric quietness while the
              landscape dances dreamlike in mirages, or the stillness is moved
              with light breezes rattling the songs of the dry grasses while
              brolgas dance and call their story of country, and fires burn.
              Then the wind blows columns of dust stories that reach far into
              the sky. Heat sizzles with the voices of ancestral spirits before
              the skies grow heavy with massive storm clouds and mighty
              thunderstorms scream through the atmosphere, and rain floods the
              rivers that are replenished with stories flowing with fish, mussel
              and turtle.

          <u>Want a grim</u> picture of the state of American dissent

          >, in a small number of states, rallying against social
          distancing measures &mdash; buoyed, of course, by tweets from
          President Donald Trump. Meanwhile, some of the most radical and
          righteous acts of mass resistance this country has seen in
          decades &mdash; from a

          networks &mdash; are earning but a fraction of the media focus
          accorded to fringe, right-wing protesters.
        </p>
        <p>
          Based on mainstream news coverage alone, for instance,
          you&rsquo;d likely never know that organizers and tenants in New
          York are preparing the largest coordinated

          >
          in nearly a century, to begin on May 1.
        </p>
        <h2>🚂🚃🚃🚃🚃 all good here! 🌴🌲🌳🎋</h2>
        <p>
          At least 400 hundred families who live in buildings each
          containing over 1,500 rent units are coordinating building-wide
          rent strikes, according to Cea Weaver, campaign coordinator for
          Housing Justice For All, a New York-based coalition of tenants
          and housing activists. Additionally, over 5,000 people have
          committed, through an
          <a href="https://actionnetwork.org/forms/mayday-cantpay"
            >online pledge</a>, to refuse to pay rent in May.
        </p>
        <p>
          Precise strike numbers will be impossible to track, but the
          number of commitments alone points to a historic revival of this
          tenant resistance tactic.
        </p>
        <h2>👿👿👿 This one's going down 👇👇👇</h2>
        <p>Coordinated rent strikes of this size in New York City 
          haven&rsquo;t been seen since the <a
            href="https://d3n8a8pro7vhmx.cloudfront.net/righttocounselnyc/pages/100/attachments/original/1585739362/RTCNYC.COVID19.4.pdf?1585739362"
            >1930s</a>, when thousands of renters in Harlem and the Bronx
          successfully fought price gouging and landlord neglect by
          refusing to pay rent en masse.
        </p>
        <p>
          The numbers committing to a rent strike might seem insignificant
          compared to the millions who don&rsquo;t frame nonpayment as a
          strike, but simply will not be able to pay rent in the coming
          month. By the first week of April, one-third of renters
          nationwide &mdash; approximately 13.4 million people &mdash; had
          <a
            href="https://www.vox.com/2020/4/8/21203754/coronavirus-housing-cancel-rent-strikes"

          >
          the ranks of the unemployed.
        </p>
        <p>
          Meanwhile, government stimulus checks of $1,200 are
          disorganized, overdue, and woefully inadequate. The median
          monthly
          <a
            href="https://ny.curbed.com/2019/6/3/18650949/nyc-rent-prices-zumper-report"
            >rent</a
          >
          for a one-bedroom apartment in New York City, for example, was
          $2,980 last year. The federal government&rsquo;s pitiful
          offering is also, of course, unavailable to many immigrants.
          Since we can therefore expect nonpayment of May&rsquo;s rent to
          reach an unprecedented scale anyway, the idea of advocating for
          a rent strike might at first seem moot.
        </p>
        <p>
          Organizers of the rent strike, however, make clear the
          action&rsquo;s relevance. The slogan of the rent strike campaign
          says it all: &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t pay? Won&rsquo;t pay!&rdquo; The
          reframing of nonpayment as a strike &mdash; an act of collective
          resistance &mdash; is a powerful rejection of the sort of
          capitalist ethic that accords moral failing to an
          individual&rsquo;s inability to pay a landlord.
        </p>
        <h1 style="column-span: all;">I'm a wide boi!!! 🦨🐕🐕‍🦺🐩🐈🐡 I cause chaos!</h1>
        <p>
          &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t need to organize a rent strike to be able
          to say that millions of New Yorkers will not pay their rent on
          May 1,&rdquo; Weaver told me. The call to a rent strike thus
          poses a crucial question to tenants who can&rsquo;t afford rent,
          Weaver said: &ldquo;Do you want to do that alone? Or do you want
          to do that connected to a movement of people who are also in
          your situation and are calling for a deep and transformative
          policy solution. It&rsquo;s better if we can do this
          together.&rdquo;
        </p>
        <p>
          For tenant organizers on the front lines of New York&rsquo;s
          housing crisis, which far
          <a
            href="https://theintercept.com/2019/05/14/universal-rent-control-bill-new-york-salazar/"
            >predated the pandemic</a
          >, the answer is clear. &ldquo;The rent strike is a cry for
          dignity: We are all deserving of a home, no matter the color of
          our skin, financial status, or culture,&rdquo; said Donnette
          Letford, an undocumented immigrant from Jamaica and a member of
          the group New York Communities for Change.
        </p>
        <p>
          Until a month ago, Letford had worked as a home health care
          attendant. Her employer of over 10 years passed away, having
          contracted Covid-19. She is now jobless and mourning in
          quarantine, having cared for her employer until her death.
          &ldquo;Under any circumstances, a loss like that is hard to
          bear, but during a pandemic it&rsquo;s devastating,&rdquo;
          Letford, a mother of one, noted in an email, urging others to
          join the rent strike. &ldquo;The Covid-19 crisis is making clear
          what many tenants have known for a long time: We are all just
          one life event &mdash; the loss of a job, a medical emergency
          &mdash; away from losing our homes.&rdquo;
        </p>
        <p>
          <u>Organizers are asking</u> those who are able to pay
          May&rsquo;s rent to refuse to do so in solidarity with those who
          can&rsquo;t. The move is aimed at pressuring city and state
          leadership to respond in the only way appropriate to the
          exacerbated housing crisis: by canceling rent.
        </p>
        <p>
          Before housing rights advocates in New York escalated calls for
          a mass rent strike, they had been calling, along with a small
          number of lawmakers, for a temporary rent suspension. And while
          New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo
          <a
            href="https://theintercept.com/2020/03/27/coronavirus-rent-suspension-evictions-bill-payments/"
            >introduced</a
          >
          a crucial eviction moratorium, without also canceling rent
          during this time, back pay will accrue and the threat of future
          evictions looms over millions of renters who have lost all
          sources of income. The rent strike is an unambiguous escalation
          to demand robust action from Albany.
        </p>
        <p>
          &ldquo;We&rsquo;re still calling to #CancelRent and reclaim our
          homes &mdash; that is the demand of the rent strike,&rdquo;
          Weaver said. &ldquo;So far, our cries for help have been ignored
          in Albany. In fact, they&rsquo;ve done the opposite of ignore
          us. Gov. Cuomo
          <a
            href="https://gothamist.com/news/cuomo-state-budget-robust-progressives-call-it-republican-austerity-warfare"
            >rammed</a
          >
          through an austerity budget that harms low-income tenants and
          homeless New Yorkers. In the face of sustained unemployment and
          a never-before-seen eviction crisis, they are offering nearly
          nothing.&rdquo;
        </p>
        <p>
          Like the historic rent strikes of the 20th century, which led to
          some of the
          <a
            href="https://scholarship.law.cornell.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1583&amp;context=clr"
            >first</a
          >
          rent control laws in New York, the coming strike makes specific
          demands. According to a
          <a
            href="https://actionnetwork.org/petitions/reclaim-our-homes-rent-suspension-now/"
            >petition</a
          >
          from Housing Justice For All, strikers want a statewide rent
          cancellation for four months, &ldquo;or for the duration of the
          public health crisis &mdash; whichever is longer&rdquo;; a rent
          freeze and the assurance that every tenant is given the right to
          renew their lease at the same price; and that the government
          &ldquo;urgently and permanently rehouse all New Yorkers
          experiencing homelessness and invest in public and social
          housing across our state.&rdquo;
        </p>
        <p>
          As Weaver put it, &ldquo;One way or another, we are looking at
          some form of government intervention.&rdquo; She added,
          &ldquo;But we need to make sure that government intervention
          happens on our terms. We are escalating to collective
          non-compliance with rent in order to force a crisis.&rdquo;
        </p>
        <p>
          <u>Concerns in response</u> to calls for rent cancellations and
          strikes are as predictable as they are unfounded. Most common
          among them is the claim that small landlords, who survive and
          pay mortgages through collecting rent, will face ruination. Yet
          it is well within the government&rsquo;s capacity to provide
          relief and support for landlords in these situations: Mortgage
          payments should be canceled too.
        </p>
        <p>
          Some of the nation&rsquo;s better lawmakers are trying to pass
          bills that combine rent and mortgage cancellations on a national
          level. On Wednesday, Rep. Ilhan Omar, D-Minn.,
          <a
            href="https://www.nbc15.com/content/news/Proposal-to-cancel-rent-mortgage-payments-nationwide-during-coronavirus-pandemic-569874291.html"
            >introduced</a
          >
          the
          <a
            href="https://omar.house.gov/media/press-releases/rep-ilhan-omar-introduces-bill-cancel-all-rent-and-mortgage-payments-during"
            >Rent and Mortgage Cancellation Act</a
          >, which would provide rent and mortgage forgiveness while also
          providing relief to landlords to assist with lost payments.
        </p>
        <p>
          Passing such legislation in Washington is perhaps a Sisyphean
          task, but it&rsquo;s more feasible on a state level. The problem
          is the political will: If Cuomo, for instance, were truly the
          &ldquo;<a
            href="https://theintercept.com/2020/03/25/coronavirus-andrew-cuomo-new-york-bail-reform/"
            >crisis daddy</a
          >&rdquo; he&rsquo;s been nauseatingly hailed to be, he could

          can take the hit of a few months&rsquo; canceled rent and

          Prior to the pandemic &mdash; and thanks to the tireless work of
          tenants&rsquo; unions, activists, and a few progressive
          Democrats elected in New York in 2018 &mdash; a number of
          pro-tenant legislative reforms were
          <a

            >passed</a
          >
          last year. These laws, while welcome, were but a small step in
          the right direction to undo the decades of unchallenged
          complicity between New York&rsquo;s politicians and the mighty
          real estate lobby. For rent strike organizers, the ideal is by
          no means a return to a pre-crisis status quo. As Weaver put it,
          &ldquo;We&rsquo;re demanding that we not return to the world we
          lived in pre-Covid &mdash; a world with 92,000 homeless New
          Yorkers and millions of people living just one paycheck away
          from an eviction.&rdquo;

          Phara Souffrant Forrest, a nurse and a tenant rights activist
          who is currently campaigning to become a New York State Assembly
          member, asked voters in her Brooklyn district of Crown Heights
          to sign a petition for rent cancellation. &ldquo;We received a
          huge amount of support for it, but then it was as if we were
          talking to ourselves, we weren&rsquo;t getting any
          response,&rdquo; she told me, decrying the lack of action from
          sitting lawmakers. She noted that 44 percent of her district was
          already &ldquo;rent burdened&rdquo; before the pandemic, meaning
          that over one-third of their paychecks went to rent and
          utilities. Four in 10 of the entire country&rsquo;s 43 million
          renters are in the same position.

          Souffrant Forrest is organizing alongside rent strikers in the
          explicit recognition that the power structures by which housing
          is organized need to be toppled &mdash; now and long after the
          coronavirus crisis has passed. &ldquo;We need to support
          candidates who believe that housing is a human right,&rdquo; she
          said. In the knowledge that all too few such politicians
          currently exist, the nurse and organizer has been calling up her
          neighbors and telling them about the rent strike.
        </p>
        <p>
          &ldquo;Housing is a human right&rdquo; has long been the cry of
          tenant organizers and social-justice fighters. What would it
          mean, though, to have a system in which housing were in fact
          treated as a universal human right? You wouldn&rsquo;t have to
          pay to access those rights, for one. A rent strike is not a
          request for the human right to housing to be recognized;
          it&rsquo;s instead an immediate and embodied claiming of that
          right. The strike makes demands, yes, but also provides an end
          in itself.
